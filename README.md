# card

Next Priorities:
	Rework shadow + visual node system into resource + visual node system
	Split a mixin base class out of visibility and card_suit
		Do this once I start migrating to a strongly typed language
	Review the below
	Complete card_deck update after card_group abstraction
	Organize cards with nodes rather than collections
	Add a testing "draw" button
	Make methods in abstract classes virtual or abstract so they can be overridden
	Don't force the playerId to be an int
	Consider splitting the CardPhase system into a general FSM system
		Also check if that doesn't already exist somewhere in a form I like
	Add a way to restrict cards from a group
	Consider making backing (non-Node) classes not Resources
	Add deck out functionality
