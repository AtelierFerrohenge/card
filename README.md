# card

Next Priorities:
	Design and implement playing zones with playing style functionality
		Such as face down, positions, etc.
		Also restrictions on card type and effects to owned cards
			May consider adding this to Group itself
	Add a testing "draw" button
	Make methods in abstract classes virtual or abstract so they can be overridden
