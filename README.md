Next Priorities:
	Design hand class and functionality
		Add per-player visibility array/dict and make all players always able to see their own hands
		(As default behavior that can be overridden by the user)
	Add a testing "draw" button
	Make methods in abstract classes virtual or abstract so they can be overridden
