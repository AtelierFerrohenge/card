# card

Next Priorities:
	Complete card_stack update after the last card_group update
	Add a testing "draw" button
	Make methods in abstract classes virtual or abstract so they can be overridden
	Don't force the playerId to be an int
	Consider splitting the CardPhase system into a general FSM system
		Also check if that doesn't already exist somewhere in a form I like
	Add a way to restrict cards from a group
	Consider making backing (non-Node) classes not Resources
	Add deck out functionality
